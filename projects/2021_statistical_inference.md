Is there any statistical evidence that English long-titled (more than 6 words)
books on Goodreads accumulate different ratings from short-titled ones? After
performing a paired t-test and practical significance test for the average
rating between subgroups (p=0.02, d=0.36), there's evidence to suggest that
the average ratings of long-titled English books listed on Goodreads are
slightly higher than those of short-titled books.
