My Obsidian vault included a mix of notes and assignments. I tested several
classification approaches to automatically organize and categorize my learning
resources with 85% test accuracy, F1 and AUC scores for Naive Bayes and 87% for
Support Vector Machine . I also performed error analysis and plotted keywords
associated the most with "assignments" as identified by Naive Bayes.
