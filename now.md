I'm actively applying for New Grad jobs in data science and AI engineering, and research labs in HCI and NLP.

I've also been volunteering to contribute to these open-source / open-science projects:

- [CommonCrawl's Web Languages]: Detect and highlight Vietnamese text on 150 website samples
- [SEACrowd-VL](https://seacrowd.github.io/): Participated in data labeling, generation, and quality control in Vietnamese to improve AI representation (Vision-Language Modeling) for Southeast Asian languages and culture
- [Humanity's Last Exam](https://lastexam.ai/): Contributed four challenging Vietnamese linguistic questions to AI evaluation benchmark
