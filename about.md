I am interested in **making human knowledge work more accessible, productive,
collaborative and enjoyable** using natural language processing, human-computer
interaction, data science, and learning sciences:

- Accessibility: Low-resource, multilingual, and multicultural adaptation
- Productivity: Knowledge management and reasoning across modalities
- Collaboration: Human-AI bi-alignment, human-AI co-creation, human-AI-data
  relationship

[Knowledge can be broadly defined](./blog/knowledge-diversity), and so I care
about many ways of accessing and producing knowledge. In the long term, I
envision a personalized, self-evolving knowledge system externalized from human
brain, but collaborate and augment human knowledge capabilities. Like a
personal, knowledgeable robot!

I graduated in May 2025 from [Minerva University](https://minerva.edu/) studying
Machine Learning & Statistics, while living and engaging civically in 6 cities
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª as part of its global rotation program. [[What am I doing?](./now)]
